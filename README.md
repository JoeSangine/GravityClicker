# GravityClicker
cookie clicker type game based in space you are the black hole and need to eat to get bigger


Feature Wish list: 

if anything is left vague or not described well please feel free to reach out or fill in the gaps!

GENERAL GAME DESIGN: any and all ideas help! If you wish to work on a feature please leave your initials on this document on what feature you would like to work on!

    BUTTONS:

 - Hidden buttons that appear when players mass = certain incrimints (ie: 100,1000,1000000,etc)

 - Have these buttons allow for players to purchase with mass and preferably allow for purchases of +5 +10, all you can aford, etc.

 - Also with these buttons attach a function that gains mass per second per amount of indidual buttons bought.for example a player has purchased 10 of buttonX buttonX already gains 1mass per second so now that the player has 10 of buttonX they gain 10mass persecond. 

 - A UI to place these buttons in.

CSS REDEISIGN:

 - Have the Black hole grow as you gain mass
 - Animations of any kind at first
 - Art for space, blackhole, ui, buttons, the things that will be eaten by the black hole(ie: planets, meteors, space debree, etc)
 - Rather than background image, we more than likely need some sort of game map that generates objects for our blackhole to consume, but in the mean time we can look for some better animations and whatnot.
 - Overall Design
 - scaling images so when black hole takes up most the screen it zooms out to reveal whats next

 ABSORBEES (the things we absorb):

 - Create entities that spawn after certain incrimints (think BUTTONS) ideas include space debree (basic = 1mass) meteorites (can varry from 5mass up to like 50mass for big ones) moons (1000 mass) planets (1000000mass) etc. these ideas are just arbitrary feel free to change actual values.
  - assign values to those entities
  - Have the entities spawn only at certain mass incriments (ie: moons wont appear until you purchase an upgrade of some sort)
  -animation of absorbing said absorbees
  - random events (ie: a martain ufo that randomly appears that doubles all the mass you gain for the next 10 minutes) 

UPGRADES: 
 -  work with whoever is doing buttons and ui for design of the store and placement of assets.
 - a store for upgrading the values of buttons
 - unique and fun upgrades of any kind you would like to see in an idle game
 - spawn rate for object upgrades
 - honestly anything you can think of that would seem fun lets get crazy and explore!

 ETC: This page will be updated as we go and used as a guide so that we can organize our work. That being said feel free to reach out to me and I will happily chat with you about anything here. NOTHING WRITTEN IS SET IN STONE IF YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA CODE IT DESCRIBE IT AND PUT IT IN THIS README FILE WITH YOUR INITIALS ATTACHED TO THE END OF IT. PLEASE TRY TO KEEP IT ORGANIZED. IE: IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA TO MAKE THE BUTTONS BETTER AND IMPLAMENT IT PUT IT IN THE BUTTONS SECTION. I am by no means perfect so if you see typos (which there will be plenty) or a better way to organize feel free. also dont be afraid to break anything and explore there will be many backups!
